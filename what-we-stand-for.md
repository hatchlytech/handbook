## values

Key values:

We are always innovating > Each member of the team has the opportunity to shape our process, practices and product. 

Flexible work arrangements > hours, location, benefits



Be Straightforward. Whenever we speak - internally or externally - we should speak plainly and clearly. Watch out for lingo, assumptions, exaggeration, or other things that get in the way of a straightforward explanation. This doesn't mean we strip the poetry and personal expression from our language, but it's got to make sense. With the exception of deep technical discussions, anyone who reads what we collectively write should simply get it without further explanation required. Don't use seven words when five will do.

Be fair and do the right thing. What's fair? What's the right thing? We all have to use our best judgment, and everyone's judgment varies, but a good rule of thumb is "what would you do for a friend or a neighbor if they asked for help?" An example might be providing a refund even if it's a little outside the refund window. Or being someone who says 'Sure we can do that for you' when a customer expected you to say 'sorry, we can't.' If the request is reasonable, grant it. At the same time, saying no is sometimes the right thing! If that’s the case, don’t feel badly about it.

Independence. This one's a bit of a contradiction. After speaking about shared values, here's one that breaks away: Independence. We encourage independent thought and original thinking. Since day one, we've always done things our way. We don't look to the industry or our competitors for the way forward. We see things with our own eyes, make our own calls, and offer thoughts, perspectives, ideas, and products that we think are right, not that they think are right.
