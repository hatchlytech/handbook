# How we work

## Cycles

hatch.ly employs a lean approach to software development.  Interations a kept to a week at a time, providing focus on the work at hand.  Our goal is to provide a prototype of the feature to allow us to validate it as soon as possible.

## hatch.ly Board

A backlog of stories is maintained.  Stories are developed to build a feature, including what the feature should provide and what the benefit and outcome for the end user.  Backlog items are prioritzed and discussed to ensure the team understands the vision of the product.

Each Monday items from the backlog are allocated to the weekly iteration.  These can be allocated by developers or the product owner.  Our goal is to allocate stories as a area of focus the product requires for the iteration.  If the work is completed during the iteration, the development team will take the additional items from the backlog.  If work is not completed, we discuss this during the iteration planning and the item moves into the next iteration.

*Our board* consists of the following stages

* TO DO
* IN PROGRESS
* WAITING RELEASE
* READY FOR QA
* DONE

## Showcase

Once a fortnight a showcase is held.  Product owners, developers and designers have an oppotunity to demonstrate something they have built since the last showcase.

This is a great time to gain feedback from the team about upcoming feature sets and demonstrate approaches taken during software development.

## Meetings

Meetings are kept to a minimum as we try to allow people to focus of the work at hand, whilst providing enough information to keep everyone up to date with our business and product activities
